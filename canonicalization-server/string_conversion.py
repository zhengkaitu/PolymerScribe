def unfold_cycles(dfta, output_folder=None):

    This function unfolds cycles. This means that it separates cycles that overlap.

    Procedure:
        1) List all states but ending states and states with self loop
        2) Sort the states by the following criteria: states with 1 input and many outputs, states with many inputs
        and 1 output, and states with many inputs and many outputs.
        3) If the state has 1 input and n outputs, replicate the state n times with one output at a time. Preserve the
        input in all of them.
            3.i) Get the output states of each output transition, named q
            3.ii) Get the transitions that go into q
            3.iii) Get the input state of each transition, named p
            3.iiii) Merge p with the states resulted from the split that have the same output to q
        4) If the state has 1 or many outputs and many inputs, replicate the state for each combination of input and
        output.

    This function removes redundant empty transitions. For example, consider this automaton: e(0)->1, e(1)->2, e(2)->3,

    """
    This functions converts a tree automaton into BigSMILES. It uses an algorithm similar to the one that converts
    deterministic finite automata into regular expressions.

    Here are the steps it follows:
        1) Sort the state machine
        2) Separate (unfold) cycles
        3) Merge transitions
        4) Replace linkers by empty transitions when necessary
            - When a linker is just like the repeat units of the resulting state, and (both states are accepting or
             both have the same transition to the same state)
        5) Make [*:1] the root of every alphabet
            - This makes it way easier to convert it back to string later → does not require string reversing
        6) Create one single start state
        7) Create one single end state
        8) Convert tree automaton into networkx graph
        9) Remove redundant empty transitions
        10) Detect cycles and adjacent cycles
        11) Define the backbone
            . Heaviest, longest path with the largest number of accepting states
            . Branch points
                . If it is not within a cycle, may be on backbone
                . If it is within a cycle and loops back to the path, may be on backbone
                . If it is within a cycle and does not loop back to the path (it is a side chain), may
                not be on backbone
        12) Define which nodes will be eliminated first
            . Prioritize nodes not along the backbone → this makes sure all side chains are collapsed first
            . Decrease priority of nodes in cycles with backbone nodes → prioritize nested and side chains
            . Increase priority of nodes with self loops → dealing with them first makes sure the nested stochastic
            objects will be treated first
        13) Eliminate nodes (convert to BigSMILES)
